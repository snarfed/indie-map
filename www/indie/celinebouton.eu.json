    "I am passionate about social economics and have been working in different structures of that field in Belgium and abroad (Canada, Philippines, Thailand, France). For 4 years I've worked on the ground in a microcredit start-up that provides micro loans and trainings to people with more ideas than financial means. I helped about 200 project holders to launch their company.\nI've initiated the MakeSense community in Brussels, an international open-source movement dedicated to helping social entrepreneurs solve their challenges and I co-founded SenseCube Brussels, an incubator for social start-ups. I believe we all are changemakers and we simply need to be connected to each other and to our local environment to act globally.",
