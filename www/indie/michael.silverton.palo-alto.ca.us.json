    "To date, the best of humanity's collective scientific rigor, juxtaposed with the most ambitious intuitions and insights that have survived the relentless gauntlet of peer-reviewed deductive reasoning, seem to indicate that we do, in a sense, all live in a yellow submarine (Beatles). That is, if said yellow submarine is considered analogous or archetypical of a holographic (Susskind) simulation (Bostrom). What'll really bake your noodle is that such theories are indeed testable and we're doing so.",
