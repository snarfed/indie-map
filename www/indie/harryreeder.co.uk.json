    "I'm a software engineer, currently working for IBM UK, for my placement year, while studying Software Engineering at Edinburgh Napier University.\nWith IBM, I currently work with the CRYSTAL Project, and do a lot of work with OSLC.\nI love to code, and especially so in Python, at the moment. I've also had varying experience in PHP, .NET, C++, Ruby and Java. Some of these have been primarily through my university course, some of these have been projects which I have used to learn the language in my own time."
