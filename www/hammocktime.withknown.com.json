    "\"Take pause to locate yourself. Not just at Adelaide Fringe, but right here, right now. In this hammock. In these trees. In this moment\". \nhammocktime invites you to pause, disconnect from technology and reconnect to yourself and your environment while contemplating three questions promoting social change. \nFestivals can be a stressful business, whether you're an artist or a punter. Treat yourself to one of our four hammocks, each with their own personal guide, and let yourself drift off into the trees. \nhammocktime standard sessions last for half an hour and are open at Gluttony from 5-8.30pm every Weds-Sun throughout the Festival. \nSpecial hammocktime evening sessions last 45minutes, starting from 9.30pm every Weds, Fri & Sat throughout the Festival. Hang out with special guests and fairy lights and enjoy a glass of fizz included in your ticket price.\nTICKETS: http://rbrt.cc/hammocktimeADLfringe\nPhotos from WOMADelaide: http://rbrt.cc/hammocktimeWord clouds from WOMADelaide: http://rbrt.cc/hammocktime2015wordcloud\nBrought to you by your personal pause consultant, Fee Plumley: http://reallybigroadtrip.com",
