Two weeks ago, after #<span class=\"p-category auto-tag\">NPSF</span> #<span class=\"p-category auto-tag\">earlygang</span>, before the 6:30 workout. I had a lot on my mind.<br class=\"auto-break\"/><br class=\"auto-break\"/>Sometimes I take things too seriously. It was two days before I was to co-teach my first public Vinyasa yoga class as part of my last weekend of YTT, graduating that Sunday after co-teaching a second class. Yoga sequences and philosophical challenges occupied my thoughts nearly every waking minute. Still do.<br class=\"auto-break\"/><br class=\"auto-break\"/>I am imperfect. Grateful for the humility reminder, and optimism that I can do better in the future.<br class=\"auto-break\"/><br class=\"auto-break\"/>I am old(er). Old enough to be grateful for every day. Old enough to feel holes in my heart every day from the losses of too many younger friends.
